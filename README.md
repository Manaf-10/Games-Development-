# Time Voyager

**Time Voyager** is a first-person adventure game about Peter, a character pulled through unstable portals into worlds that should never be connected. Every portal throws him into a new place with its own danger, rules, allies, and escape condition.

From a haunted mansion to a dragon dungeon, a futuristic city, a fantasy kingdom, a samurai village, and a mysterious lab, Peter must survive each world long enough to open the next portal. The game mixes exploration, quests, item collection, combat, NPC dialogue, locked paths, and world-to-world progression.

## 🌀 Game Progression

The game is built around portal-based progression. Each level acts like a chapter in Peter's journey:

1. Peter enters a new world.
2. The player explores the environment and discovers the objective.
3. NPCs, locked doors, enemies, or collectible items create the challenge.
4. Completing the main quest unlocks a portal or transition.
5. Peter moves into the next world.

## ⚙️ Core Systems

### 📜 Quest System

Quests guide the player through each world. They track objectives, show progress, and decide when important gates, rewards, or portals should unlock.

### 🤝 Interaction System

The player can look at objects and interact with them using prompts. This system is used for doors, NPCs, portals, pickups, computers, panels, and story objects.

### 🎒 Inventory System

The inventory stores collected items such as keys, treasure, power cells, gas bottles, fruit, and other quest items. These items help unlock doors, complete objectives, or progress dialogue.

### ⚔️ Combat and Enemies

Combat includes melee enemies, ranged enemies, robot attacks, enemy spawning, weapon use, ammo, reloading, hit effects, and enemy defeat tracking.

### ❤️ Health System

The player and enemies have health. Damage lowers health, healing restores it, and player death reloads the current level after a short delay.

### 🚪 Doors, Locks, and Progress Gates

Doors and gates control progression. Some require keys, some require completed quests, and others require multiple steps before they open.

### 🌀 Portal and Scene Transitions

Portals connect the worlds. Some portals are available after discovery, while others only activate when the player finishes the required level objective.

### 🗣️ NPC, Dialogue, and Voice Lines

NPCs help guide the player through the story. They give objectives, play voice lines, react to completed quests, and move Peter toward the next goal.

### 🚚 Vehicle, Cutscene, and Mission Guidance

The future level includes truck driving, guided mission markers, scripted delivery moments, traffic movement, and cinematic quest transitions.

### 🖥️ UI, Pause, and Settings

The game includes interaction prompts, quest display, health display, ammo display, pause menu, settings, instructions, credits, and main menu navigation.
